# 🎓 FinGuard Beginner's Guide - Your First AI Project!

## 🎉 Welcome! You've Built Your First AI System!

### What You Have Running:
- ✅ **Smart Fraud Detection AI** - Running on your computer
- ✅ **Web API** - Like a website that other programs can talk to
- ✅ **Real-time Processing** - Gets answers in milliseconds!

---

## 🎮 Let's Play With Your AI! (3 Easy Ways)

### 🌐 **Method 1: Web Browser (Super Easy!)**

1. **Open any web browser**
2. **Type**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. **Press Enter**

You'll see a beautiful page called "FastAPI" - this is YOUR creation! 🎨

**What you'll see:**
- Green boxes = Things your AI can do
- Click on any green box to try it!

#### 🎯 **Try This First:**
1. Click on the green **"GET /health"** box
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. Click **"Execute"**
4. See the result: `{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}` ✅

**Congratulations!** You just talked to your AI! 🎉

#### 🕵️ **Now Test Fraud Detection:**
1. Click on **"POST /fraud/predict"** (the big one!)
2. Click **"Try it out"**
3. You'll see a box with transaction data - this is fake data for testing
4. Click **"Execute"**
5. **BOOM!** Your AI will tell you if it thinks this transaction is fraud!

---

### 💻 **Method 2: PowerShell (What We Just Did)**

You already have this file: `test_api_fixed.ps1`

**To run it again:**
1. Open PowerShell (search "PowerShell" in Windows)
2. Navigate to your project: `cd "C:\Users\bharg\OneDrive\Documents\Project1-Finguard"`
3. Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test_api_fixed.ps1`

**What it does:**
- Tests if your AI is awake ✅
- Sends a fake transaction to check for fraud ✅
- Shows you the results! ✅

---

### 🧪 **Method 3: Create Your Own Test (Advanced)**

Create a file called `my_test.py`:

```python
import requests
import json

# Test data - a suspicious transaction
suspicious_transaction = {
    "Time": 3600,      # 1 AM (suspicious time)
    "Amount": 5000,    # High amount
    "V1": 3.0,         # Unusual pattern
    "V2": 2.5,
    "V3": 2.8,
    "V4": -0.3,
    "V5": 0.6,
    "V6": -1.2,
    "V7": 0.9,
    "V8": -0.4,
    "V9": 1.8,
    "V10": -0.1
}

# Send to your AI
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/fraud/predict",
    json=suspicious_transaction
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Is Fraud: {result['is_fraud']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"Probability: {result['fraud_probability']}")
```

---

## 🎯 Understanding the Results

### **When you test a transaction, you get:**

```json
{
  "is_fraud": false,
  "fraud_probability": 0.1,
  "risk_level": "low"
}
```

**What this means:**
- **is_fraud**: `true` = "This looks like fraud!" / `false` = "This looks normal"
- **fraud_probability**: Number from 0 to 1 (0 = definitely safe, 1 = definitely fraud)
- **risk_level**: "low", "medium", or "high"

### **Real-World Translation:**
- **Low Risk** (0-0.3): "Looks like a normal purchase" ✅
- **Medium Risk** (0.3-0.7): "A bit suspicious, maybe check it" ⚠️
- **High Risk** (0.7-1.0): "Very suspicious, probably fraud!" 🚨

---

## 🔍 What Makes Transactions Suspicious?

Your AI looks for patterns like:

### 🚨 **Red Flags:**
- **Time**: Transactions at 2 AM are more suspicious
- **Amount**: Very high amounts ($5000+) are suspicious
- **Patterns**: The V1-V10 numbers in unusual ranges
- **Frequency**: Too many transactions too fast

### ✅ **Green Flags:**
- **Normal hours**: 9 AM - 5 PM are safer
- **Normal amounts**: $10-$500 are typical
- **Normal patterns**: V1-V10 in expected ranges

## 🎮 Fun Things to Try

### **Experiment 1: Normal vs Suspicious**

**Normal Transaction:**
```json
{
  "Time": 43200,     # 12 PM (normal time)
  "Amount": 25.50,   # Small amount
  "V1": 0.1, "V2": -0.1, "V3": 0.2, "V4": -0.2,
  "V5": 0.1, "V6": -0.1, "V7": 0.1, "V8": -0.1,
  "V9": 0.1, "V10": -0.1
}
```

**Suspicious Transaction:**
```json
{
  "Time": 3600,      # 1 AM (weird time)
  "Amount": 9999,    # Huge amount
  "V1": 5.0, "V2": 4.0, "V3": 3.0, "V4": -3.0,
  "V5": 4.0, "V6": -4.0, "V7": 3.0, "V8": -3.0,
  "V9": 5.0, "V10": -4.0
}
```

**Try both and see the difference!**

### **Experiment 2: Time of Day**
- Try the same transaction at different times
- Morning (36000) vs Night (3600)
- See how time affects the fraud score!
