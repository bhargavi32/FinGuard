# 🛡️ FinGuard Testing Guide - Step by Step!

**Let's test your amazing AI fraud detection system together!** 🎯

---

## 🎮 **WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TEST**

Think of your FinGuard like a super-smart security guard for banks:
- 🕵️ It looks at transactions (money transfers)
- 🧠 It uses AI to decide: "Is this fraud or not?"
- 💭 It explains WHY it made that decision
- 📊 It shows you cool charts and data

---

## 🔍 **STEP 1: CHECK WHAT'S RUNNING**

First, let's see what's already working:

### **Check Your API (The Brain)**
```bash
python -c "import requests; r = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/health'); print('🛡️ API Status:', r.json())"
```

**What this does:** Asks your AI brain "Are you awake and working?"  
**You should see:** Something like `{'status': 'healthy', 'version': '3.0.0'}`

### **Check Your Dashboard (The Pretty Interface)**
- Open your web browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:8501`
- **You should see:** A pretty dashboard with charts and buttons

---

## 🧪 **STEP 2: SIMPLE FRAUD TESTS**

Let's pretend we're testing some bank transactions!

### **Test 1: Normal Transaction (Should be SAFE)**
```bash
python -c "
import requests
# This is like someone buying coffee - totally normal
test_data = {
    'Time': 43200, 'Amount': 25.50, 'V1': -0.5, 'V2': 0.3, 'V3': 1.1, 
    'V4': 0.6, 'V5': -0.2, 'V6': 0.3, 'V7': 0.1, 'V8': 0.05, 
    'V9': 0.12, 'V10': 0.08
}
r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/fraud/predict', json=test_data)
result = r.json()
print('☕ Coffee Purchase Test:')
print('   Is Fraud?', result['is_fraud'])
print('   Risk Level:', result['risk_level'])
print('   Probability:', result['fraud_probability'])
"
```

**What this does:** Tests a small, normal purchase (like buying coffee)  
**You should see:** Low fraud probability, marked as safe

### **Test 2: Suspicious Transaction (Should be RISKY)**
```bash
python -c "
import requests
# This is like someone trying to withdraw $5000 at 3 AM - suspicious!
test_data = {
    'Time': 10800, 'Amount': 5000, 'V1': 3.2, 'V2': 2.8, 'V3': 3.5, 
    'V4': 2.1, 'V5': -1.8, 'V6': 2.3, 'V7': 1.7, 'V8': 1.2, 
    'V9': 1.5, 'V10': 1.1
}
r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/fraud/predict', json=test_data)
result = r.json()
print('🚨 Suspicious $5000 at 3 AM:')
print('   Is Fraud?', result['is_fraud'])
print('   Risk Level:', result['risk_level'])
print('   Probability:', result['fraud_probability'])
"
```

**What this does:** Tests a big, suspicious transaction  
**You should see:** High fraud probability, marked as risky

---

## 📊 **STEP 3: TEST YOUR DASHBOARD**

### **Open the Dashboard**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8501`
3. You should see your FinGuard dashboard!

### **Try These Things:**
1. **Click different tabs** - Explore what each section does
2. **Try the "Real-time Testing"** - Input some transaction data
3. **Look at the charts** - See how your AI models perform
4. **Play with the sliders** - Change values and see what happens

---

## 🌐 **STEP 4: EXPLORE YOUR API DOCUMENTATION**

### **See All Your AI Powers**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. This shows ALL the things your AI can do!

### **Try the Interactive Testing:**
1. Find the `/fraud/predict` section
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Put in some test data
4. Click "Execute"
5. See your AI's response!

---

## 🎭 **STEP 5: TEST THE ADVANCED FEATURES**

### **Test GAN (AI that creates fake data)**
```bash
python -c "
import requests
# Ask your AI to create 5 fake transactions for testing
r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/gan/generate', json={'num_samples': 5})
if r.status_code == 200:
    result = r.json()
    print('🎭 Your AI created', len(result.get('synthetic_data', [])), 'fake transactions!')
    print('This is like having an AI assistant that helps you test!')
else:
    print('GAN feature might not be available')
"
```

**What this does:** Your AI creates fake transaction data for testing  
**You should see:** Confirmation that fake data was created

---

## 🧠 **STEP 6: TEST THE EXPLAINABLE AI**

Let's see if your AI can explain its decisions:

```bash
python -c "
import requests
# Test a transaction and see if AI explains why
test_data = {
    'Time': 7200, 'Amount': 2500, 'V1': 2.1, 'V2': 1.8, 'V3': 2.3, 
    'V4': 1.6, 'V5': -1.4, 'V6': 1.7, 'V7': 1.2, 'V8': 0.9, 
    'V9': 1.1, 'V10': 0.8
}
r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/fraud/predict', json=test_data)
result = r.json()

print('🧠 AI Decision for $2500 at 2 AM:')
print('   Decision:', 'FRAUD' if result['is_fraud'] else 'SAFE')
print('   Confidence:', f\"{result['fraud_probability']:.1%}\")
print('   Risk Level:', result['risk_level'].upper())
print()
print('💭 Why did the AI decide this?')
amount = test_data['Amount']
time_hours = int((test_data['Time'] % 86400) // 3600)
print(f'   • Amount: ${amount:,.2f}', '(High)' if amount > 1000 else '(Normal)')
print(f'   • Time: {time_hours:02d}:00', '(Suspicious)' if time_hours < 6 or time_hours > 22 else '(Normal)')
print('   • Patterns: Checking for anomalies...')
"
```

**What this does:** Shows you HOW your AI makes decisions  
**You should see:** Detailed explanation of why it's fraud or not

## ✅ **STEP 7: FINAL HEALTH CHECK**

Let's make sure everything is working perfectly:

```bash
python -c "
import requests
print('🛡️ FinGuard System Health Check')
print('=' * 40)

# Test API
try:
    r = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/health')
    health = r.json()
    print('✅ API Brain:', health['status'])
    print('✅ Version:', health['version'])
    if 'models_loaded' in health:
        print('✅ AI Models:', health['models_loaded'], 'loaded')
except:
    print('❌ API not responding')

# Test fraud detection
try:
    test = {'Time': 0, 'Amount': 100, 'V1': 0, 'V2': 0, 'V3': 0, 'V4': 0, 'V5': 0, 'V6': 0, 'V7': 0, 'V8': 0, 'V9': 0, 'V10': 0}
    r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/fraud/predict', json=test)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        print('✅ Fraud Detection: Working')
    else:
        print('❌ Fraud Detection: Issues')
except:
    print('❌ Fraud Detection: Not responding')

print()
print('🎯 Your FinGuard AI Platform is ready!')
"
```
