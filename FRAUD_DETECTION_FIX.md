# 🔧 FinGuard Fraud Detection Fix

## 🚨 **CURRENT PROBLEM**

Your FinGuard API is working perfectly **technically**, but the fraud detection is **too lenient**:

| Transaction | Amount | Time | Expected Risk | Current Result | Issue |
|-------------|---------|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Suspicious | $3,500 | 2:00 AM | HIGH (70-90%) | 2.4% | ❌ Too Low |
| Normal | $25.50 | 1:00 PM | LOW (0-10%) | 0.0% | ✅ Correct |

## 🎯 **WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED**

The **fraud scoring rules** in your API are too conservative. Here's what should happen:

### **For Suspicious Transaction ($3,500 at 2 AM):**
- **Amount Risk:** $3,500 should add +0.5 points (not +0.2)
- **Time Risk:** 2:00 AM should add +0.4 points (not +0.1) 
- **Pattern Risk:** 8 unusual V-features should add +0.3 points
- **Combined Risk:** Multiple factors should add +0.2 bonus
- **TOTAL:** Should be ~80% fraud probability

### **For Normal Transaction ($25.50 at 1 PM):**
- **Amount Risk:** $25.50 should add +0.0 points ✅
- **Time Risk:** 1:00 PM should add +0.0 points ✅  
- **Pattern Risk:** Normal patterns should add +0.0 points ✅
- **TOTAL:** Should be ~0% fraud probability ✅

## 🔧 **HOW TO FIX IT**

### **Option 1: Simple Rule Update (Easiest)**
The fraud detection rules in your API need to be more aggressive:

```python
# Current (too lenient):
if amount > 1000: fraud_score += 0.3
if hour < 6 or hour > 22: fraud_score += 0.1

# Should be (more realistic):
if amount > 3000: fraud_score += 0.5
if amount > 2000: fraud_score += 0.4  
if amount > 1000: fraud_score += 0.25
if hour < 6 or hour > 22: fraud_score += 0.4
```

### **Option 2: Machine Learning Training (Advanced)**
Train your AI models on real fraud data with proper labels.

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
Combine rule-based detection with ML models for best results.
